🚀 Project Title

Electric Vehicle Range Predictor
Predict your EV’s range in real-time based on weather, terrain, and driving conditions.

📘 Project Description

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the estimated range of an electric vehicle (EV) under various conditions — such as temperature, road type, and driving behavior. The aim is to help drivers and manufacturers optimize performance and battery efficiency.

🌍 Project Vision

To empower EV users and researchers with data-driven range prediction tools, reducing “range anxiety” and enabling smarter energy management for the future of sustainable transport.

🔑 Key Features

✅ Machine Learning model trained on EV technical & environmental data

⚙️ Predicts real-world range based on:

Battery Capacity

Temperature

Terrain/Road Type

Driving Mode (Eco, Sport, Normal)

Speed and Load

📊 Interactive dashboard/UI for input and prediction

🔋 Range optimization tips (based on predicted loss factors)
